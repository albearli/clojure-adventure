# clojure-adventure

This is the final project for CS 296 FA2019. This Clojure text-based adventure is made by Albert (Yiliang) Li, Theodore Li, and Matthew Pham (yiliang6, ttl2, and mdpham2 respectively).

## How To Play
Navigate to ```clojure-adventure/interaction/adventure/src/adventure/core.clj``` and run ```lein run``` to get started!


This adventure has quite a few rooms, so a paper and pencil would be helpful. Also, there is one room where you just die from entering :)
